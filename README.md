Welcome to LIRI Bot!

What is LIRI Bot?
LIRI Bot is like iPhone's SIRI. However, instead of utilizing speech interpretation like SIRI, LIRI uses language interpretation. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters you type into the terminal and returns data.

What can LIRI Bot do for you?
LIRI will be able to return data to you from three different APIs:
    1. OMDB - Input a movie name and LIRI will return data on that movie fetched from the OMDB API
    2. Bands in Town - Input an artist name and LIRI will return data on upcoming concerts for that artist
    3. Spotify - Input a song name and LIRI will return data on that song

How do I tell LIRI what to do?
